 * Summary: Resets all mailbox registers in dual core devices
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *     (none)
 * 
 * Returns:
 *      uint16_t:   0 = failure
 *                  1 = success
 * 
 * Description:
 * This function clears all mailbox registers in Dual Core devices.
 * 
 * Please Note:
 * Mailbox registers are assigned to a certain core at compile time using 
 * FUSES (configuration bits). Only the assigned core has WRITE access while 
 * the register appears as "READ ONLY" to the other.
 * 
 * As access to these registers may be restricted dependent on this 
 * assignment, only the registers which have WRITE access will be cleared.
 *
